* This is a resubmission addressing this problem: "Apparently your package no longer works correctly when class(matrix(...)) gives a vector of length two and conditions of length greater than one in 'if' or 'while' give an error: please fix as necessary." The package was removed from CRAN but now has been fixed.

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.5.1
* ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.5.1
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
